# businessplots

A library to quickly draw business quality bars.

# Usage:



## TODO
- enhance API so that all options can be customized (color, etc.)
- set a config dict + defaults to easily plot
- rewrite pretty_title to handle a smaller subtitle
- add businessplots.source to quickly add a source below the chart
- same for ylim, xlim ==> provide a method to auto compute them
- new types of arrows
- change default font to a beautiful one (if exists)
- waterfall
- add support for stacked bars
- ability to set units once at all
